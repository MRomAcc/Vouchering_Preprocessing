# Vouchering Preprocessing

This repository contains scripts for preprocessing voucher-related data. Below are the steps to set up the environment, install dependencies, and a brief explanation of each script.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To isolate dependencies, create a virtual environment:
```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `cleanup.py`
This script is used for removing CSV files.

### 2. `check_headers.py`
Located in the `check and fix headers and format/` directory, this script verifies the headers of CSV files and ensures they are consistent.

### 3. `merge_csv_by_headers.py`
Located in the `check and fix headers and format/check_headers_output/` directory, this script merges multiple CSV files based on their headers.

### 4. `match_case_insensitive.py`
Located in the `Extract rows matched in case insensitive manner/` directory, this script extracts rows from a dataset that match a given pattern in a case-insensitive manner.
## Folder Structure
- **Input mask/**: Contains input mask files.
- **Input source/**: Contains source data files.
- **Output folder/**: Contains output files generated by the scripts.

### 5. `extractUniqueCodes.py`
Located in the `Extract unique voucher codes/` directory, this script extracts unique voucher codes from the provided data.

### 6. `split_into_parts.py`
Located in the `Split into parts/` directory, this script splits large datasets into smaller parts for easier processing.


## Notes
- Ensure that the virtual environment is activated before running any script.
- Modify the scripts as needed to suit your specific data preprocessing requirements.
